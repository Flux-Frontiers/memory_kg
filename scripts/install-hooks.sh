#
# Why snapshots are off by default (2026-08-18)
# ---------------------------------------------
# A per-commit snapshot records `git write-tree` and is then itself staged into
# that same commit. Staging changes the index, so the recorded hash can never
# equal the tree it claims to describe — and manifest.json carries a
# `last_update` timestamp, so the `git add` is never a no-op. The drift is
# guaranteed by construction, not caused by formatting.
#
# An audit of 605 snapshots across 29 fleet manifests found 63 (10.4%) keyed to
# a tree any commit actually has. `snapshot diff` between adjacent entries has
# therefore been comparing states that never existed.
#
# The fix is to snapshot at release, keyed on the tag rather than on an
# ephemeral pre-commit tree. See kgrag_priv/docs/SNAPSHOT_STRATEGY.md. Until
# that lands, this hook runs quality checks only.

# checks at all, while the hook actually installed here had them — the two had
