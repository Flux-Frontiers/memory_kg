# Release Notes — v0.4.0

> Released: 2026-03-14

### Added
- VS Code workspace file (`src/memory_kg/memory_kg.code-workspace`) for IDE integration
- `analysis/memory_kg_analysis_20260314.md`: CodeKG architectural analysis report (2026-03-14)
- `Snapshot.issues` field: list of issue-description strings now stored per snapshot
- `Snapshot.key` property: stable alias for `tree_hash`, used as the file key throughout

### Changed
- `src/memory_kg/snapshots.py`: replaced `commit` field with `tree_hash` as the stable snapshot key
  - `Snapshot.commit` removed; `Snapshot.tree_hash` is the new primary identifier
  - `Snapshot.key` property returns `tree_hash` for use as file key and manifest lookup
  - `SnapshotManager._get_current_commit()` renamed to `_get_current_tree_hash()`
  - `capture()` accepts `tree_hash` kwarg (was `commit`); auto-detects via `git write-tree` if omitted
  - `from_dict()` silently drops legacy `commit` field for backward-compatible loading
  - `load_snapshot()` now backfills `vs_previous` from manifest ordering when absent in the JSON file
  - Updated module docstring with full usage example and field-level inline comments
- `src/memory_kg/cli/cmd_snapshot.py`: `--commit` CLI option renamed to `--tree-hash`; issues list forwarded to `capture()`
- `.github/workflows/snapshots.yml`: updated `memorykg snapshot save` invocation from `--commit` to `--tree-hash`
- `tests/test_snapshots.py`: full test suite rewrite — all tests ported to `tree_hash`-based API, helper `_make_snapshot` replaced by `_make_memorykg_snapshot`, added new tests for git helpers, `vs_previous` backfill, and `issues` field
- `src/memory_kg/cli/group.py`: new module that houses the root Click group, extracted from `main.py` to eliminate circular imports between the entry-point and `cmd_*` submodules
- `pylint ^4.0.5` dev dependency with full `[tool.pylint.*]` configuration in `pyproject.toml` (design/format/similarities/messages_control sections)
- `code-kg` (git) dependency added to `pyproject.toml` for CodeKG integration
- All `cmd_*` CLI modules (`cmd_analyze`, `cmd_build`, `cmd_hooks`, `cmd_mcp`, `cmd_query`, `cmd_snapshot`, `cmd_viz`) now import `cli` from `memory_kg.cli.group` instead of `memory_kg.cli.main`, resolving circular import issues
- `src/memory_kg/cli/main.py`: reduced to re-exporting `cli` from `group.py` and registering submodule imports
- `src/memory_kg/cli/cmd_hooks.py`: Enhanced pre-commit hook with quality checks integration
  - Hook now runs `.pre-commit-config.yaml` checks (ruff, mypy, detect-secrets, etc.) before snapshot capture
  - Hook rebuilds local MemoryKG index (`memorykg build --wipe`) to keep it in sync with commits
  - Changed success message from `✓` emoji to `OK` prefix
- `.github/workflows/snapshots.yml`: Refactored snapshot workflow for consistency
  - Simplified build phase to use unified `memorykg build --wipe` instead of separate `build-graph` and `build-index` commands
  - Changed snapshot keying from short commit hash (`SHORT_COMMIT`) to full tree hash (`TREE_HASH` via `git write-tree`)
  - Replaced ad-hoc `memorykg analyze` output with structured `memorykg snapshot save` command
  - Workflow now commits and pushes snapshots directly to repository instead of uploading as artifacts
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Fixed pylint hook to run via `poetry run` for access to project dependencies (was failing with import errors)
- `pyproject.toml`: Updated `pre-commit` dependency to `^4.5.1`
- `src/memory_kg/relations.py`: split overlong regex literal across multiple lines; simplified `cooccur_pairs` to `list(itertools.combinations(...))` directly
- Code quality: added missing public-method docstrings in `kg.py`, `snapshots.py`, `app.py`; added targeted `pylint: disable` annotations in `memorykg.py`, `index.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `topics.py`; fixed bare `except ImportError` chain in `cmd_mcp.py`
