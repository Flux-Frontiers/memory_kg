"""tests/test_mcp_server.py

Import-level regression tests for memory_kg.mcp_server.

The server builds its ``FastMCP`` instance and registers every tool with
module-level decorators, so an incompatible ``mcp`` release breaks it at
*import* time — and only for people installing from PyPI, since a developer's
pinned lock file keeps working.

mcp 2.0 removed the bundled ``mcp.server.fastmcp`` module (FastMCP was split
out into the standalone ``fastmcp`` package), which makes the import at
``mcp_server.py`` line 16 fail outright. `pyproject.toml` pins ``mcp<2`` for
that reason; these tests fail loudly if the pin is lifted without porting the
server, rather than shipping a broken console script.

Note the failure mode is not uniform across the fleet: KGRAG uses the
low-level ``Server`` API, whose class still imports under mcp 2.0 but whose
decorators were removed — so it fails at *call* time instead, and needs a
different test shape.
